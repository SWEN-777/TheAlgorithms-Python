# Project Proposal


## Project Overview

[TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) is an open-source repository for learning, practicing, and understanding algorithms in Python. It offers a curated collection of algorithm implementations that serve as a reference, educational resource, and practical toolkit for both students and developers. It covers a wide range of domains, including blockchain, cryptography, data compression, data structures, linear algebra, and more.

## Key Quality Metrics

For the purpose of this assignment, we will be diving into the **[Data Structures](https://github.com/SWEN-777/TheAlgorithms-Python/tree/master/data_structures)** directory to evaluate its key quality metrics.

### Testability

#### Number of Unit Test Cases

While many examples are provided for the data structure algorithms, the following reflects the number of proper unit tests available in each section:

| Section       | Unit Tests |
|---------------|------------|
| Arrays        | 1          |
| Binary Tree   | 21         |
| Disjoint Set  | 1          |
| Hashing       | 2          |
| Heap          | 0          |
| KD Tree       | 3          |
| Linked List   | 13         |
| Queues        | 0          |
| Stacks        | 1          |
| Suffix Tree   | 5          |
| Trie          | 2          |
| **Total**     | **49**     |

#### Test Coverage

The repository does not include dedicated test coverage scripts, so an accurate coverage percentage could not be determined.
