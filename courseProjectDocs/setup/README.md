# How to Run Tests

For the purpose of this assignment, we will be diving into the **[Data Structures](https://github.com/SWEN-777/TheAlgorithms-Python/tree/master/data_structures)** folder's testing. Since there is no proper test setup in place, the team has included a script to help run the tests in this folder and generate a test coverage report.

To reproduce the test results and summary, please follow the listed steps.

1. Naviagte to the testing script from root:

```
cd courseProjectDocs/setup
```

2. Run the testing script:

```
python test_coverage.py
```

3. The output you see on your terminal will match the [coverage screenshot](https://github.com/SWEN-777/TheAlgorithms-Python/blob/master/courseProjectDocs/setup/testCoverage.png) and [test results](https://github.com/SWEN-777/TheAlgorithms-Python/blob/master/courseProjectDocs/setup/testResults.pdf)
