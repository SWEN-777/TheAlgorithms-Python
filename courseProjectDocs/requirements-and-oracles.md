# Requirements and Test Oracles

## Functional Requirements

The described data structures should be able to:
1. **Traversal:** Enable traversal methods (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order for trees; forward/backward for linked lists).
2. **Sorting:** Provide built-in or integrable sorting mechanisms where applicable.


## Non-Functional Requirements

The data structure should ensure:
1. **Testability:** Design should allow easy integration with unit testing frameworks.
