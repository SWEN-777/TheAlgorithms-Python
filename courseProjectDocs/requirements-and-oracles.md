# Requirements and Test Oracles

## Functional Requirements

The described data structures should be able to:
1. **Traversal:** Enable traversal methods (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order for trees; forward/backward for linked lists).
2. **Sorting:** Provide built-in or integrable sorting mechanisms where applicable.
3. **Search & Access:** Support efficient search and retrieval of elements.
4. **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle invalid operations (e.g., removing from an empty queue).


## Non-Functional Requirements

The data structure should ensure:
1. **Testability:** Design should allow easy integration with unit testing frameworks.
2. **Performance / Efficiency:** Operations should be optimized for time and space complexity (e.g., O(1) for stack push/pop).
3. **Scalability:** Data structures should handle large datasets without significant performance degradation.
