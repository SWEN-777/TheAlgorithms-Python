# Requirements and Test Oracles

## Functional Requirements

The described data structures should be able to:
1. **Search & Access:** Support efficient search and retrieval of elements.
2. **Insertion & Deletion:** Allow insertion and deletion operations at appropriate positions.
3. **Traversal:** Enable traversal methods (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order for trees; forward/backward for linked lists).
4. **Sorting:** Provide built-in or integrable sorting mechanisms where applicable.
5. **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle invalid operations (e.g., removing from an empty queue).
6. **Integration with Algorithms:** Data structures shall support direct usage with sorting, searching, or graph algorithms.


## Non-Functional Requirements

The data structure should ensure:
1. **Performance / Efficiency:** Operations should be optimized for time and space complexity (e.g., O(1) for stack push/pop).
2. **Scalability:** Data structures should handle large datasets without significant performance degradation.
3. **Reliability:** Functions should consistently return correct results under normal usage.
4. **Testability:** Design should allow easy integration with unit testing frameworks.
5. **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend.
